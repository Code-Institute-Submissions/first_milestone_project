# Brandon Mongo Portfolio

This is my first milestone project under the topic of User Centric Frontend Development that has been administrated by the Code Institute.

The Purpose of my portfolio is to showcase my wide range of coding skills that I’ve learned during my time studying with the coding Institute to future potential employers and recruiters.  In additional give a little information about myself, what I’ve done in my past and give employer and recruiter a platform to contact me.

## UX

### User Stories 

As mentioned before, this portfolio is targeted at employers and recruiters. As an employer I want to see what skills Brandon Mongo can bring to the company.

As a recruiter I would like to view information about Brandon Mongo that will be valuable to companies that are looking to hire new employees.

### Strategy

My aim for this project was to design a simple way for potential employers to learn about Brandon Mongo and the skills that he has. While provide a smooth friendly user experience for anyone viewing the website on different devices such as mobiles, tablets and desktops. 

### Scope

For employer I wanted to give them a sense of who Brandon Mongo is and what he can do. So, they can understand his background, view work his done in the past, the skills his has and provide them a choice to contact to Brandon if they choose to.

### Structure

The overall structure to my homepage, resume and contact page has a hero image which was implemented to grab the user’s attention keeping them focus on the website. The homepage tells the users basic information such as name and title and a brief descriptive paragraph about me. Resume page more details about myself and provides a timeline of my qualification and work history. I wanted visitor of the site to have access to my cv and reference.

### Skeleton

### Surface

The colour scheme for the site is different shades of grey for the navigation bar and footer which matches with the hero image, with the main body being a cream colour which blends with the grey to give the website a professional and smooth feel.

## Technology

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.4.1)

## Features 

The site uses the carousel feature from bootstrap which is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, so in this case it was used to exhibit a snapshot of different projects that I’ve done in the past.  In addition, there a button to view the project in more detail. This feature allows me to save screen space but compacting all in the project in one area, by do this the website doesn’t look to clustered.

### Features left to Implement 

If I was to do this project again in future, on the projects/skills page in the skills sections I would add animation to the progress bar when the user hovers above each skill. Another thing I’ll add animations to the hero image, like a shrink then back to normal transition when the page loads and add a picture my actual self. Make the commits more descriptive.

## Testing

I feel this project has achieved the needs of the employer and recruiter as stated in the user story by displaying information about myself and what I can do through the website and past projects. On the home page you can see a picture of a professional and to the left of that there’s a bio you can read about brandon.  When you click on the resume link on the navigation bar at the top of the page, it’ll take you to the resume page where the user will more information about brandon, qualification and work history split into 3 different sections on the page. On the projects/skills there a slide show of different project with arrow on either side letting the user flick through the slides at there own pace with an indicator on what slide you’re on at the bottom with a link to view each project. Underneath that there a progress bars on the different skills Brandon has. The contact page there a form where the user can fill in to contact Brandon and the if any section of the form is not filled in then the site would allow the form to be submitted with an signal telling the user to fill that section if they want to submit the form.
The navigation bar has a button on right hand side that lets the visitor to do download a traditional CV. On the footer there is icons of different social which are links directing the user to social site and with a button that lets them download Brandon’s reference on the right-hand side. Both button when you hover over them with the mouse on your desktop the text becomes bold.
All the linked apart from the home, resume, projects/skills and contact page all have “target=_blank” class with opens a new tab when the linked has been clicked on so the user doesn’t lose there place on the website and can easily go back to where they were. All links have been manually tested to make sure they are working correctly.
The slideshow has too been tested with the previous and next arrow working and the slide automatically flicking to the next slide after a certain amount of time.
The website has been tested on different browsers 	such as chrome and internet explorer, plus has been tested on multiple devices for example Iphone 6,7,8, X Samsung galaxy, pixel phone and iPad and iPad pro. When testing the site on these devices I realise that the download CV button and the download reference button didn’t fit on the mobile version, so I got rid of them both. The download CV button was replaced with a link place in the nav bar and the download reference button was substituted with a download icon link that is placed below the social links. The nav bar was too big for the mobile version so it was switched with a three-bar button on the top right-hand side of the page. On the resume page the information section the when using “display: inline-block” the writing would over flow onto the other section so using the media query on smaller devices changed the code to “display: block” which fixed the problem by stacking the writing.

## Deployment

The website is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will automatically update new commits to the master branch. To deploy the site to correctly on GitHub pages, I named the home page index.html.

### Credits

## Content

All content on the home, resume, projects/skills and contact page was written by me such as the bio, qualifications, work history, etc.

## Media 

The hero image, picture of the professional men on the home page and imeche image on the project/skills were all taken form the advanced google image search. But other image is a primary source, the icons in the footer are from the website font awesome.

## Acknowledgements

For the completion project I’ll have to give acknowledgement to the coding institute tutor for aided me throughout this project and being available to help when needed.

Centring the image on the home page code was taking from w3schools.com with my own modifications to fit the needs I wanted in terms of styling and size. (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp).

The coding institute Putting It All Together Mini Project with Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrapping Your Next Big Idea With Bootstrap 4  Beyond Bootstrap lesson were a big inspiration to this project.
